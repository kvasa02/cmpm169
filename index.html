        <h1>Koushik Vasa</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
        <p>Hi everyone! I'm Koushik, a third-year CS:GD major. I have a deep passion for technology and problem-solving, which led me to pursue computer science. Outside of my studies, I love staying active by playing soccer, which has taught me a lot about teamwork and perseverance. In my downtime, you’ll usually find me watching movies, listening to music, or walking my dog, who is always excited for our daily adventures. I also enjoy playing games, both video and board games, which I find a great way to unwind and challenge myself.

            In terms of my programming skills, most of my experience comes from the courses I've taken at UCSC. I'm comfortable with Python, Java, C++, C, and JavaScript, and I’ve worked on various projects that have helped me grow both as a programmer and as a critical thinker. I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and apply it to real-world problems. As I continue to learn, I aim to develop software that can make a positive impact on the world, whether through creating innovative applications or optimizing existing systems.
